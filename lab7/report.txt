Answers to 4 Questions:
1. 14 Pins. Minimum 2.16V and maximum 3.6V
2. We write to them because we want to let the program know what memory address the magnetometer and the accelerometer values start at.
3. This takes the raw data from the accelerometer and updates the accel_data array with x, y , z values at index 0, 1 , 2 respectively.
4. Tilt compensation is necessary because the pitch and roll affect the heading calculation. For example, when the pitch is 45 and the roll is 45, the heading direction vector is pointing upwards, and we need to compensate for that upward shift.

Difficulties:
	- It was quite hard to understand how top read the accelerometer/magnetometer values to begin with.
	- Once I got those, everything was fairly straightforward. The visual representations took more time than anthing else, but it was less than what I needed last time as I ended up re-using some functions, and I has a good grasp over the overall functioning of the LCD.


What I Learnt:
     - I learnt that documenting your code and adding explanatory comments in projects (labs in this case) is crucial as it helps streamline use of previously written code better.
